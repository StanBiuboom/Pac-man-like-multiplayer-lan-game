# Pac-man-like-multiplayer-lan-game
course work for COMP90020 Distributed Algorithms
In the subject “COMP90020 Distributed Algorithms”, I have built a Pac-Man-Like multiplayer LAN game in which the distributed algorithms called: “Consistent Hashing” and the “Time Vector” were implemented. I was the leader of the 4-people group and I wrote almost all of the codes.
